1.Objectives
• Become familiar with HTML and CSS technologies
• Learn how to imitate a web page
2.Description
Composing documents directly in HTML and CSS is very helpful as it is often necessary to modify existing documents. 
Also, when writing server-side scripts one must generate HTML.
• In this assignment we were given an image of a web page. The task was to reproduce the page as closely as possible, writing HTML and CSS directly, that is without using anything more than a text editor. The web page to be imitated can be found here.
• Important Note: use of CSS is required
• We are also given five png images to help  complete the web page: side_bottom.png, side_main.png, side_top.png, header.png and footer.png.
• Please note that if you view the PNG image of the sample web page in a browser, some browsers will automatically resize the image to fit within the browser window.
• The page contains a menu on the left and a menu at the bottom of the page. In the left menu there are six (6) active links labeled “Home”, “Reviews”, “Deals”, “Follow Us”, “Tip Us” and “Contact Us”. 
  The same links are duplicated across the footer of the page, in a slightly smaller font, for a total of 12 links.
• On the page you are going to build, the active links should be made to point to the same page, say X.html at your website.
￼￼￼￼￼￼
The page X.html was divided into six parts, each separated by a horizontal line. Each part began with a paragraph tag that looks like this
<p id=”Home”>
This is the start of X.html which corresponds to the “Home” link.
• You are to construct the twelve (12) links so that when a person clicks on a link, (e.g. they click on “Home”) the page X.html is displayed and the section of X.html that has the corresponding name as the name of the link, is placed at the top, (i.e. the page scrolls up).
• To test this hw#3, please view your web page using Firefox. Resize your browser window to the same size as the PNG image and then see if you have used the correct font, color and size, and if the position of text is correct.
•Important Note: The www-scf.usc.edu web server automatically places a message at the bottom of every HTML page. The message begins with “USC does not screen or control the
content . . . “ Due to this appended message, the HTML will get misaligned. To avoid this message you can add a <noscript> tag immediately in front of the </body> tag or click on the Announcements page to see more suggestions.
